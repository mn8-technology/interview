# Instructions

Don't do all the problems - only do 3 or 4
(Pick the ones you find interesting - it tells me something about you)

The "recap" package contains a summary of the coding techniques that you might find useful

Fork the repo and send a pull request when you are done (see <https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/>), or else download the repo as a zip file (see under code menu) and email the source files of the problems you have solved.
